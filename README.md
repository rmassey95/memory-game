# Memory Game

A simple memory game created as part of an Odin Project assignment which displays some movie poster images on the screen. The user must click all the movie posters while being sure not to select a movie poster that has already been selected. After each selection of a movie poster, the order of the posters is rearranged to make it harder on the user.

## Usage

Clone the repo and type `npm install`. Once completed type `npm start` to open up the React app and start the game!
